# Edx-Git-and-GitHub-Final-project
This Repo contains the necessary files required for the completion on my Git and GitHub course on EDX.

The bash code enables the user to enter 3 values namely:
  1. Principle
  2. Rate of interest
  3. Time span

Then it calculates the "Interest amount" and "Total amount".
These Values will get displayed to the user on terminal or Console.

# Additional capabilities added
  1. Error handling : code rejects any values other than numbers ( decimal and Natural ).
  2. Float point operation: code can take handle decimal numbers and do the math.

# Possible Update
  1. Continuous calculation ability prompts user to "continue or quit".
  2. Responds accordingly.
